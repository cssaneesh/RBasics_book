# List & Data frame
Lists are very important in R because almost all structured data that belongs together is stored as lists. Objects are special kinds of lists. Data is stored in special kinds of lists, so-called data frames or so-called tibbles.

A data frame is base Râ€™s standard format to store data in. A data frame is a list of vectors of equal length. Data sets are instantiated with the function `data.frame`.

## Making a data frame

```{r}
name = c("saneesh", "sanusha", "appu", "jaru")
sex = c(2, 0, 5, 8)

df <- data.frame(name, sex)

df <- # df= data frame
  data.frame(name = c("saneesh", "sanusha", "appu", "jaru"),
             sex = c(2, 0, 5, 8))
```
