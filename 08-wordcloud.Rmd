```{r}
# install.packages("dplyr")
# install.packages('wordcloud')

# add packages----
library(dplyr) # to clean data
library(wordcloud) # to make wordcloud
```

### Read data

```{r}
words <- data.frame(Name= c(rep('James Bond', 30),
                    rep('Iron Man', 20),
                    rep('Spider Man', 5),
                    rep('Caption America', 4)),
                    Tag= c(rep('Spy', 30),
                               rep('Super hero', 29)),
                    Duty= c(rep('kill', 30),
                            rep('developer', 20),
                            rep('save', 5),
                            rep('save', 4)))

str(words) # display the internal structure `object`, here, our `data`

head(words, 3) # change the number in the () and see more rows
tail(words, 3)
```


```{r}
# let us see what is the duty of our heros
names(words) # to see the column names of words

# to add count to the data
words1 <- words %>% count(Duty) # words1 is a new data frame we created from words
```

```{r}
names(words1)
max(words1$n) # copy this number for max.words=

# par(bg="black") # for black background
```

Before you plot, make sure that the `Files`, `Plot` `Packages` panel is maximized!! click on the rectangular button on top of the File, Plots, Packages window.

```{r}
wordcloud(word = words1$Duty, # BroaderGoal from the words1
          freq = words1$n, # n from the words1 data frame
          min.freq = 1, # minimum frequency of a word
          max.words = 14, # maximum frequency of a word
          random.order=T,
          # colors = brewer.pal(6, 'GnBu') # remove comment from
          # these code one by one and see how color change
          # colors = brewer.pal(6, 'Reds')
          # colors = brewer.pal(6, 'Blues')
          # colors = brewer.pal(1, 'Reds')
          colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2")
          )
```

Let us see what are they known as
```{r}
names(words) # to see the column names of words

# know the data
words2 <- words %>% count(Tag)

names(words2)
max(words2$n) # copy this number for max.words=
```


Before you plot, make sure that the plot window or Plot pane is maximized!! click on the rectangular button on top of the `File`, `Plots`, `Packages` window.
```{r}
# par(bg="black") # for black background

wordcloud(word = words2$Tag, # BroderBackground from the words2
          freq = words2$n, # n from the words2 data frame
          min.freq = 1, # minimum frequency of a word
          max.words = 10, # maximum frequency of a word
          random.order=T,
          # vfont= c(family= 'gothic english', face= 'plain'), # fonts, remove comment from
          # these code one by one and see how font and color change
          # vfont= c(family= 'script', face= 'plain'),
          # vfont= c(family= 'serif', face= 'plain'),
          # vfont= c(family= 'sans serif', face= 'plain'),
          vfont= c(family= 'serif', face= 'cyrillic'),
          # colors = brewer.pal(6, 'GnBu') # colors
          colors = brewer.pal(6, 'Reds')
          # colors = brewer.pal(6, 'Blues')
          # colors = brewer.pal(1, 'Reds')
          # colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2")
)
```


If the plot doesn't look good restart R from Session tab or press Ctrl+Shift+F10, then start from add packages :). If you want to change background bg= "black" or other colors do the above, restart. If you are happy with a plot,  Export> Save as PDF> select PDF Size> change directory if you want.

It will look something like this!
