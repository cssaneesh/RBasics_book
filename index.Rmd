# About

This is an introduction to Basics of R using `tidyverse` packages (Figure 1.1) and wrote using the `bookdown` package.

## Installation

Download and install `R`. Follow the link below and choose the appropriate version.

Link: [R-Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)  
Link: [R-Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)  
Link: [R-Ubuntu](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/fullREADME.html)  

Download and install `RStudio`. `RStudio` is an interface which facilitates coding in `R`. We recommend `RStudio` Desktop.

## Project
RStudio projects make it straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents.
1. Make a `New Folder`
```{r, echo= FALSE, out.width= "70%", fig.align='center', fig.cap= 'New Folder'}
 knitr::include_graphics('pictures/Slide5.jpg') 

```
E.g, I made a folder `TISS_R` 


```{r, echo= FALSE, out.width= "70%", fig.align='center', fig.cap= 'New Folder'}
 knitr::include_graphics('pictures/Slide6.jpg') 

```

2. Open `RStudio` and start a `New Project`

```{r, echo= FALSE, out.width= "70%", fig.align='center', fig.cap= 'New Project'}
 knitr::include_graphics('pictures/Slide7.jpg') 

```
Or from `File` > `New Project`
Because we have a folder made with name `TISS_R` I am going to select `Existing Directory` if you don't have a folder select `New Directory` and select a location. The name of the directory or the folder will be the new project's name.

```{r, echo= FALSE, out.width= "70%", fig.align='center', fig.cap= 'Existing Directory'}
 knitr::include_graphics('pictures/Slide8.jpg') 
```

```{r, echo= FALSE, out.width= "70%", fig.align='center', fig.cap= 'Create'}
 knitr::include_graphics('pictures/Slide9.jpg') 
```

```{r, echo= FALSE, out.width= "70%", fig.align='center', fig.cap= 'Open'}
 knitr::include_graphics('pictures/Slide10.jpg') 
```

```{r, echo= FALSE, out.width= "70%", fig.align='center', fig.cap= 'Create Project'}
 knitr::include_graphics('pictures/Slide11.jpg') 
```

```{r, echo= FALSE, out.width= "70%", fig.align='center', fig.cap= 'Done: New Project'}
 knitr::include_graphics('pictures/Slide12.jpg') 
```
