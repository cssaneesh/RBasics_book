The following table summarizes all base R arithmetic operators. Arithmetic operators + Plus – Minus * Multiplication / Division ^ Exponential ** Exponential Basic operations 3 + 5 # 8 ## [1] 8 8 - 3 # 5 ## [1] 5 7 * 5 # 35 ## [1] 35 1/2 # 0.5 ## [1] 0.5 4 ^ 4 # 256 ## [1] 256 4 ** 4 # 256 ## [1] 256 5 %% 3 # 2 ## [1] 2 5 %/% 3 # 1 ## [1] 1 2.2 Functions R has many built-in functions. The most common situation is that the function is called by its name using prefix notation, followed by round brackets that enclose the function’s arguments (separated by commas if there are multiple arguments). For example, the function round takes a number and, by default, returns the closest integer: # the function `round` takes a number as an argument and # returns the closest integer (default) round(0.6213) ## [1] 1 round allows several arguments. It takes as input the number x to be rounded and another integer number digits which gives the number of digits after the comma to which x should be rounded. We can then specify these arguments in a function call of round by providing the named arguments. round(0.6213, digits = 2) ## [1] 0.62 Example of another function, sum sum(1, 2, 3) ## [1] 6 2.3 Reserved words There are also reserved words you can’t use, like TRUE, FALSE, NULL, among others. You can see the full list of R reserved words typing help(Reserved) or ?Reserved. It not advisable to use these words outside quotes (’’, ““) or backtick (`) quotes. 2.4 Variables You can assign values to variables using three assignment operators: -&gt; &lt;- = a &lt;- 6 # assigns 6 to variable a 7 -&gt; b # assigns 7 to variable b c = 3 # assigns 3 to variable c, use of = is not widly accepted! d &lt;- a * b / c # assigns 6 * 7 / 3 = 14 to variable d d # returns d ## [1] 14 Use print() function to see the output print(a) print(7) print(c) print(d) 2.5 Documenting code It is good practice to document code with short but informative comments. Comments in R are demarcated with #. round( # call the function `round` sum(2.213*3.123),# find sum of 2.213*3.123 digits = 2 # show the sum with two digits after the `.` ) ## [1] 6.91 In RStudio, you can use Command+Shift+C (on Mac) and Ctrl+Shift+C (on Windows/Linux) to comment or uncomment code, and you can use comments to structure your scripts. Any comment followed by —- is treated as a (foldable) section in RStudio. # SECTION: variable assignments ---- x &lt;- 6 y &lt;- 7 # SECTION: some calculations ---- x * y ## [1] 42 2.6 Relational / comparison operators in R Comparison or relational operators are designed to compare objects and the output of these comparisons are of type boolean. To clarify, the following table summarizes the R relational operators. Relational operators in R &gt; Greater than &lt; Lower than &gt;= Greater or equal than &lt;= Lower or equal than == Equal to != Not equal to 3 &gt; 5 # FALSE ## [1] FALSE 3 &lt; 5 # TRUE ## [1] TRUE 3 &gt;= 5 # FALSE ## [1] FALSE 3 &lt;= 5 # TRUE ## [1] TRUE 3 == 5 # FALSE ## [1] FALSE 3 != 5 # TRUE ## [1] TRUE 2.7 Data types To learn a programming language entails to first learn something about what kinds of objects we will have to deal with. Let’s therefore briefly go through the data types. We can assess the type of an object stored in variable x with the function typeof(x). x &lt;- 1 typeof(x) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; x &lt;- &quot;hello&quot; typeof(x) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; x &lt;- TRUE typeof(x) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; x &lt;- mean typeof(x) ## [1] &quot;closure&quot; It is possible to cast objects of one type into another type using functions as. in base R. x &lt;- as.numeric(1) # &quot;double&quot; typeof(x) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; x &lt;- as.character(1) # &quot;character&quot; typeof(x) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; "],["installing-r-packages.html", "Chapter 3 Installing R packages", " Chapter 3 Installing R packages An R package is a library of functions that have been developed to cover some needs or specific scientific methods that are not implemented in base R. The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) is the official R packages repository, with thousands of free R packages available. Most of them have been developed by Data Scientists, Statisticians, Professors and researchers. First, you need to look for the name of the package you want to install. You may want to research for your topic googling something like: ‘graphics package R’ or ‘R package for time series’. Once you decided what package to install, just call the install.packages function with the name of the package inside the parenthesis () with quotation marks \" \" or ' '. As an example, we are going to install the calendR package, that allows creating monthly and yearly calendars, but you can install the package you prefer. install.packages('calendR') Once you see a similar looking message in the Console “The downloaded binary packages are in”drive user downloaded_packages”, it is good idea to add a comment # before install.packages like this # install.packages('calendR') to avoid installing the same package again and again! After installation, you need to load the package if you want to access its functions. For that purpose, you can load it with the library function, specifying the package name with or without quotation marks. library(calendR) ## ~~ Package calendR ## Visit https://r-coder.com/ for R tutorials ~~ Once loaded, you can use ? or the help function with the package name or the name of any function to see the documentation. You will also find useful examples to understand how the package works. ?calendR help(\"calendR\") help(calendR) In addition, you can find out where the packages are going to be installed calling the .libPaths() function. .libPaths() ## [1] &quot;C:/Users/ty00osat/Documents/R-4.3.2/library&quot; Alternatively, you can install R packages from the menu (Package). Figure 3.1: Pacage In RStudio go to Tools → Install Packages and in the Install from option select Repository (CRAN) and then specify the packages you want. If you need to install several packages at once without writing the same function over and over again, you can make use of the c function within the install.packages function. Note that now the quotation marks are needed to specify the packages names. install.packages(c(\"ggplot2\", \"dplyr\")) Once installed, you can get a list of all the functions in the package. If the package is on CRAN, you will find documentation in PDF format of all functions inside a page like https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/package_name. Recall you can access this documentation in HTML format with the help function. help(package = ggplot2) "],["vectors-matrices.html", "Chapter 4 Vectors &amp; matrices 4.1 Numeric vector 4.2 Mathematical operation 4.3 Indexing 4.4 Numeric matrices 4.5 Names for vectors, matrices and arrays 4.6 Characters or strings", " Chapter 4 Vectors &amp; matrices R is essentially an array-based language.

Therefore, the factor object takes a bounded number of different values called levels. Factors are very useful when working with character columns of data frames, for creating barplots and creating statistical summaries for categorical variables. For plotting or other representational purposes, it can help to manually specify an ordering on the levels of a factor using the levels argument. factor(factor_vector, levels = c(&#39;large&#39;, &#39;medium&#39;, &#39;small&#39;)) ## [1] small medium large ## Levels: large medium small levels(factor_vector) # ordered the way we want ## [1] &quot;large&quot; &quot;medium&quot; &quot;small&quot; days &lt;- c(&quot;Friday&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Thursday&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Sunday&quot;, &quot;Saturday&quot;) # Levels in alphabetical order my_factor &lt;- factor(days) my_factor ## [1] Friday Tuesday Thursday Monday Wednesday Monday Wednesday ## [8] Monday Monday Wednesday Sunday Saturday ## Levels: Friday Monday Saturday Sunday Thursday Tuesday Wednesday Convert numeric to factor in R.

Cochin Hence, you will have something like the following data stored in a numeric vector: # Sample data city &lt;- c(3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2) Now, you can call the factor to convert the data into factor and get it categorized for further analysis. my_factor &lt;- factor(city) my_factor ## [1] 3 2 1 4 3 2 ## Levels: 1 2 3 4 If the input vector is numeric, as in the previous section, the corresponding label (the city) is not reflected.

To do this, you’ll need to have your data correctly formatted and saved in a file format that R is able to recognise. Fortunately for us, R is able to recognise a wide variety of file formats, although in reality you’ll probably end up only using two or three regularly. Saving files to import The easiest method of creating a data file to import into R is to enter your data into a spreadsheet using either Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc and save the spreadsheet as a comma delimited file. To save a spreadsheet as a comma delimited file in Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc select File -&gt; Save as … from the main menu. You will need to specify the location (project folder) you want to save your file in the ‘Save in folder’ option and the name of the file in the ‘Name’ option. In the drop down menu located above the ‘Save’ button change the default ‘Save as type:’ to ’CSV(Comma delimited) (*.csv)’. Once you’ve saved your data file in a suitable format we can now read this file into R. If you don’t have a *.csv don’t worry, we will make one using the write.csv function. df &lt;- # df= data frame data.frame(name = c(&quot;saneesh&quot;, &quot;sanusha&quot;, &quot;appu&quot;, &quot;jaru&quot;), sex = c(2, 0, 5, 8), height = c(167, 158, 110, 50)) # copy the name of the data frame `df` write.csv(df, # copied name file= &#39;family.csv&#39;, # a new file will be made in the project folder with name family.csv. Go check after running the code! row.names = FALSE) # to avoid auto generated row names Now to read the newly created family.csv file to R or any other file there are many ways. family &lt;- read.csv(file= &#39;family.csv&#39;) str(family) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 4 obs. of 3 variables: ## $ name : chr &quot;saneesh&quot; &quot;sanusha&quot; &quot;appu&quot; &quot;jaru&quot; ## $ sex : int 2 0 5 8 ## $ height: int 167 158 110 50 The other method is to import file from Files, Plots, Packages panel. Go to Files Figure 7.1: Files .csv file and Figure 7.2: Files .csv file Look at the data preview, import options (change Name if needed), click Import. or copy code from code preview, click on cancel and paste the code on the script panel and Run.

Visualization, though it also involves some information loss, can be less so when executed effectively.

This process of gaining a deep understanding is integral to data analysis, and visualization plays a crucial role in it.
